# 🕵️ Deepfake Detection

## 📖 Introduction

Deepfakes are AI-generated synthetic media where a person’s likeness is manipulated to produce fake but realistic videos or images. With the rapid spread of such content, building a robust deepfake detection system has become essential.
This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based deepfake detector that classifies input images as REAL or FAKE.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔎 Detect whether an input image is real or fake.

- 📉 Minimize false positives and false negatives.

- 🧠 Train a robust CNN model with dataset balancing.

- 📊 Compare results with different architectures.

  ---

  ## 🗂️ Dataset Description

✅ Sources: Publicly available deepfake datasets & custom collected samples.

📁 Categories:

REAL images (authentic, unaltered faces).

FAKE images (AI-manipulated/deepfake).

⚖️ Dataset Balancing: Since fake images were more than real ones, data augmentation was applied on real images to balance classes.

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing

- Resized all images to (128×128).

- Normalized pixel values.

- Augmented real images to balance dataset.

2. Model Training

- Used CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout layers.

- Optimizer: Adam, Loss: Binary Crossentropy.

- Metrics: Accuracy.

3. Evaluation

- Compared training and validation performance.

- Generated accuracy & loss curves.

- Built confusion matrix.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Conv2D layers for feature extraction.

- MaxPooling layers for downsampling.

- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

- Flatten + Dense layers for classification.

- Sigmoid activation for binary output (REAL/FAKE)
